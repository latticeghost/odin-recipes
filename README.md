It also contains anchor links built using <a></a> element with 'href' attribute that redirect the users to other pages, void elements(elements which do not have a closing tag) such as <meta> & <img>. Ordered and unordered lists are also constructed using <ol></ol> & <ul></ul> respectively, which contain list items constructed with <li></ul> tag. Elements used for headers include <h1></h1> & <h2></h2>. Paragraphs use the <p></p> element, which also contain <strong></strong>, <b></b> & <em></em> elements.
